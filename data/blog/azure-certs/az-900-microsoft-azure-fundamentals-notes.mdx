## AZURE ARCHITECT

### Region & Availibility Zones

**Region**

- A set of data centers deployed within a latency-defined perimeter and connected through a dedicated regional low-latency network

**How to choose**

- Location -> closest to the users to minimize latency
- Features -> some features are not available in all regions
- Price -> vary from region to region

**Paired regions**

1. Each region is paired
2. Outage failover
3. Planned updates
4. Replication

**Availability Zones (AZ)**

- Physical location within a region
- Independent
- 3 zones minimum

### Resource Groups & Azure Resource Manager

**Resource Group**

- Everything is inside a resource group
- Facts:
  - One resource -> 1 RG
  - Add / remove at anytime
  - Move resources from one to another
  - Multiple region resources can be in 1 RG
  - Access control can be on RG level
  - Interacts with other resources from other RG
  - RG has a location or region to store metadata in it

**Azure Resource Manager (ARM)**

- Manage all resources and all interactions through the ARM
- Benefits
  - Group Resource Handling -> Can deploy, manage, and monitor resources as a group
  - Consistency -> Deploying resources from various tools will always result in the same consistent state
  - Dependencies -> Define dependencies between resources to make sure they do not conflict with each other over resources
  - Access Control -> Built-in features in the ARM make it easy to assign access rights to users
  - Tagging -> Tag resources to identify them for future scenarios quickly; tagging is a way to label individual resources
  - Billing -> Leverage tags to stay on top of billing for groups of resources

## COMPUTE

### Virtual machine

- A part of Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
- Manage everything except the hardware, including the networking components
- Tools -> Azure Portal to manage VMs (even hybrid clouds)
- Compliance -> Azure blueprints to make your VMs comply with guidelines
- Recommendations -> Azure will recommend improvements to ensure better security, higher availability, and greater performance
- Choices:
  - RAM
  - CPUs
  - OS
- Pricing -> Calculated Hourly. More resources, higher cost per hour
- Use Cases

|                     Cons                      |                                                  Pros                                                  |
| :-------------------------------------------: | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
|              Not for everything               |                                                Control                                                 |
| It is often worth using another Azure service |                      Application -> install specific on Windows or Linux machines                      |
|         Maintenance -> a lot with VM          | Existing infrastructure -> can move existing resources and VM to Azure from on-premise or other Clouds |
| OS system updates, patches, security concerns |                                                                                                        |

**-> Core of Azure compute & are widely used**

### Scale sets

- A group of identical, load-balanced VMs
- Benefits
  - Multiple VMs -> easy to manage VMs using an LB
  - High Availability -> If one fails or stops, the others in the scale set will keep working
  - Auto Scaling -> Automatically match demand by adding or removing VMs from the scale sets
  - Large Scale -> Run up to 1000 VMs in 1 scale set
  - No extra cost -> No added cost, just the cost of resources
- Use cases: for better elasticity

**EXAM TIPS**

- Set of identical VMs. They can be activated & deactivated as needed
- A baseline VM for scale set ensures application stability
- No more cost, just cost for the resource you use

## NETWORKING

### Virtual Network

|        Term        | Definition                                                            |
| :----------------: | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|   Address Space    | Range of IP addresses available                                       |
|      Subnets       | Subnet network into portions to manage                                |
| Resource Grouping  | Group resources onto the same subnet to make it easier to monitor     |
| Address Allocation | More efficient to allocate addresses to resources on a smaller subnet |
|  Subnet Security   | Use network security groups to secure individual subnets              |

**Subnet Regions and Subscriptions**

|                                Regions                                |                   Subscriptions                    |
| :-------------------------------------------------------------------: | :------------------------------------------------: |
|             A virtual network belongs to a single region              | A virtual network belongs to just one subscription |
| Every resource on the virtual network must be in the same region, too | A subscription can have multiple virtual networks  |

- Cloud Advantages
  - Scaling -> Adding virtual networks or more addresses to a network is simple
  - High Availability -> Peering virtual networks, using a load balancer, or using a VPN gateway will all increase the availability
  - Isolation -> Manage and organize resources with subnets and network security groups

**VNet Peering**

- Benefits
  - Low latency with high bandwidth
  - Link separated networks
  - Data transfer easily within the network

**EXAM TIPS**

- VNet = fundamental part of your Azure infrastructure
- An address space is a range of IP addresses you can use for your resources
- A subnet is a smaller network, a part of your VNet
- VNet = single region + single subscription
- VNet can scale and have HA & isolation

### Load balancer

- Distributes new inbound flows that arrive on the Load Balancer's frontend to backend pool instances, according to rules and health probes

- Scenarios:
  1. Internet traffic
  2. Internal networks
  3. Port forwarding
  4. Outbound traffic

### VPN Gateway

**Components**

- Azure VNet & VPN Gateway
- Tunnel with protocols
- On-premises gateway

-> site-to-site connections

**EXAM TIPS**

- VPN GWs are instrumental in a hybrid cloud architecture
- A VPN GW is a specific VNet GW. It consists of 2 or more dedicated VNets
- VNet GW + VPN = VPN Gateway
- Send encrypted data between Azure and on-premise network
- Azure GW subnet, secured tunnel & on-premise GW make up VPN GW scenarios

### Application Gateway

**Benefits**

- Scale up/down -> Scale the application gateway up or down based on the amount of traffic received
- Encryption -> Comply with any security policies, disable or enable traffic encryption to the backend
- Zone redundancy -> Span multiple availability zones and improve fault resiliency
- Multi-site hosting -> Use the same application gateway for up to 100 websites

**EXAM TIPS**

- Application GW is a high-level load balancer
- Works on HTTP request of the traffic instead of the IP address and port
- Traffic on a specific web address goes to a specific machine
- Fit for most Azure services

### Content delivery network (CDK)

- A distributed network of servers that can deliver web content via the edge node closest to the user.

**Benefits**

1. Better performance
2. Scaling
3. Distribution -> Edge servers will serve requests closest to the user. Less traffic is then sent to the server hosting the application

**Terms**

- Cache on edge -> Collection of temporary copies of original files
- Origin server -> Original location of the files, such as a web application

### Express Route

<small>Equivelant AWS Direct Connect</small>- Super fast connection which don't go over the Internet
- if you need a private, secure, high-bandwidth, low-latency connection directly from your data
center or infrastructure to Azure -> ExpessRoute

## STORAGE

- Storage account must be unique across global (identical to AWS S3) as every object has its web address

### Blob

- Binary Large Object -> pretty much anything
- Storage Levels: Storage Account → Container → Blob
