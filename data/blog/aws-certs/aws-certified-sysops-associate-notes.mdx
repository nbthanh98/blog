## IAM: users and Groups

### Root user

- The user created when the AWS account is created
- The credentials are the email & password used when signing up for the AWS account
- By default, the root user has full administrative rights & access to every part of the account

### Best practices for the root user

- We should not use the root user for daily work & administration
  - another account that has admin rights should be used
- The root user account should not access keys. Delete them if they exist
- The root user should use MFA

### IAM User

- A new user has an implicit deny for all AWS services and requires a policy be added to grant them access
- Users receive unique credentials (username, password & access keys)
- Users can have IAM policies applied directly to them, or they can be a member of a group that has policies attached
- With policies, an explicit deny always overrides an explicit allow from attached policies
  - for instance, AWS will ignore all policies attached to a user if a single deny-all policy is added

#### Best practices for users

- Never store or "pass" your credentials to EC2 instances - use SSH forwarding
- MFA can and should be used for users' accounts
- Access credentials are unique and should never be shared

### IAM Groups

- Allow for policy assignments to multiple users at the same time
- We may assign permission to a group
- More organized and efficient way's to manage users and policies
- Cannot be nested
- Users may be the members of multiple groups

#### Rest practices for groups

- Organize users by functions
- Assign IAM policies to groups, not individual users

### IAM policies

- A document that states one or more permissions (JSON formatted)
- An explicit deny always overrides an explicit allow.
- This allows for the users of a deny-all policy to quickly restricts all access a user may have

#### Managed policies

- AWS provides pre-built policy templates to assign to users & groups
- Examples include:
  - Administrator access: Full access to all AWS resources
  - Power-user access: Admin access, except it does not allow user/group management
  - Read-only access: Only view AWS resources (e.g., user can only view what is in S3 buckets)

#### Custom policies

- You can create custom IAM policies using the policy generator or write them from scratch
- More than one policy can be attached to a user/group at the same time
- Policies can not be directly attached to AWS resources (such as an EC2 instance)

### IAM Roles

- Temporary security credentials in AWS managed by Security Token Service (STS)
- Another entity can assume the specific permissions defined by the Roles
- These entities include:
  - AWS resources (e.g., EC2 instance)
  - A user outside of AWS needs temporary access

#### Roles with AWS services

- We must use role because policies cannot be attached directly to AWS resources
- Services can only have one role attached at a time
- You should never pass or store credentials to an EC2 instance - instead, use role
- You may change the role of running EC2 instances through the console or URI

#### Other uses of Roles

- Cross-account access (delegation)
  - Provide access to another AWS account from another account
- Identity Federation
  - Users ordside AWS can assume a role for temporary access to aws account and resources
- These users assume an identify provider access role
- Example identity providers:
  - Active Directory
  - Single sign on providers: like Facebook, Google, Amazon

## IAM: Multi -Factor Authentication (MFA)

### What is Multi -Factor Authentication?

- A security method that requires multiple seperate authentications
- One authentication option we nave with AWS uses time-based codes.
- Familiar examples of MFA: ATM to withdraw morey, both physical card & a PIN

### AWS Scenario

- Enable MFA in order to access AWS console:
  - Users type in their username and password as well as a time-based code
  - The username and password are not enough to be authenticated
  - The time-based code can be on the user's computer, smartphone or a device they carry around
- This should be turn on for users who have access to the console
- MFA Delete for S3 obrects can be used to mitigate acidental deletions

## Amazon 53: Bucket Policies

- JSON statement used to allow or deny permission across obfects in a single bucket

### Elements of a Pucket Policies

#### Effect

- Define whether to allow or deny the action

#### Action

- Actions we want to allow or deny
- Important **An explicit deny always override an explicit allow**

#### Resource

- Used to identity resources (like a bucket & object) with ARNs

#### Principal

- An account or users that this policy applies to
- Specific to S3 bucket policies, not user policies

#### Sid (Optional)

- Statement identifier that provides a way to indude information about an individual statement

#### Condition (Optional)

- Specify condition for when the policy is in effect

## S3 Data Integrity

### Versioning

- Enable to store new versions for every modification or deletion
  - Help with accidental deletion by creating Dersions for deleted obrects

### Replication

- Object are replicated across AZ automatically
- Standard and Infrequent Acces options at differents price options

### Multi-Factor Authentication Delete (MFA Delete)

- MFA to prevent accidental deletion of objects
  - Requires Versioning enable on a bucket
- We can enforce the use of MFA in order to permanently delete an object
- Only root account (the bucket owner) can access this feature

## Amazon VPC: Security Group and NACLS

### VPC (Virtual Private Clond)

- Isolate workloads into separented VPCs (based on applications , department, test, dev, etc)

### Security Groups

- Group instances with similar functions
- Stateful = every allowed TCP or UDP ports will be allowed in both directions.

### NACLS (Network Access Control list)

- Stateless = inbound and outbound rules are separate, no dependencies
- Granular control over IP protocols (allow and deny rules for inbound and outbound evaluated in order)
- Work with security groups (NACLs applies for the whole subnet, security groups app to members)
- Ephemeral ports: Client requests depending on OS(port 1024-65535)

### Host-based Fire walls: Os-level frewalls as needed

## AWS STS: Federation

### Secure Token Service (STS)

An extensions of IAM that allows for management of temporary security credentials for IAM users or federated users

- It allows for granular control of how long the access remains active
  - Fifteen minutes to one hour (default = 1 hour)
- Credentials are not stored with the user or service granted temporary access
  -A token is attached to the access request of API call
- Beneficial in a mumber of ways
  - Low risk of credentials being exposed (not distributed)
  - Do not have to create IAM identities for every user
  - Because they are temporary in nature, there is no need to rotate keys
- STS uses a single endpoint
  - This single endpoint resides in us-east-1
  - Latency can be reduced by using STS API calls to regions that support them
  - Temporary credentials have global scope, just like IAM

### Identity Federation

- Federation: Providing a non-AWS user temporary AWS access by linking that user's indentity accross multiple identity systems
- Federation with Third-Party Providers:
  - Most commonly used in web and mohile applications
  - Amazon Cognito allows for creation of unique identities for users
  - Uses identity providers to federate them: Facebook, Google, Amazon, etc
- Establishing Single-Sign-On (SSO) using SAML2.0
  - Most commonly used in enterprise environment with an existing directory system
    - Active Drectory,...
  - Federated users can access AWS resources using their corporate domain account
  - Federation also aids user management by allowing central management of accouts

## Amazon Inspector

Inspector can

- Analyze the behavior of your AWS account
- Test network accessibility and security state
- Assesses for secunty vulnerabitaties and deviations from best pratices
- **Target**: A collection of Ecz instances
- **Assessment template**: Composed of security rules and produce a list of findings
- **Assessment run**: Applying the assegment tiplate to a tanget
- **Findings**: Security report, organized by severity level
- **Features**:
  - Configuration scanning and activity monitoring engine:
    - Determines what a target look like, its behavior, and any dependencies it may have
    - Identifies security and compliances issues
